# Apps

In this folder, there are some small apps to demostrate how to use WPF to develop programs.


## Lists

- #### [MouseTracker](./MouseTracker)

    In this App shows how to track the mouse cursor and add a highlight.

- #### [S3Uploader](./S3Uploader)
    In this App shows how to use S3API to implement an object storage client. Now it only provides uploading function. I am going to improve this App recently to become a full-function S3 object management application.
